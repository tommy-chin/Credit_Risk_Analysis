# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Purpose
A P2P lending services company named Fast Lending was interested in using machine learning to predict the credit risk of its potential loaners. To perform this credit risk data analysis, credit card data from a company named LendingClub was used. This analysis aims to perform machine learning with various different models to better understand which models have the most ideal accuracy, precision, and recall scores for credit risk. 
## Results
For this data analysis, six different machine learning models were used which are listed below.
* Naive Random Sampling
